# ./JQ

## Overview

jq is written in C and has no runtime dependencies, so it should be possible to build it for nearly any platform. Prebuilt binaries are available for Linux, OS X and Windows.

The binaries should just run, but on OS X and Linux you may need to make them executable first using `chmod +x jq`.

jq is licensed under the MIT license. For all of the gory details, read the file `COPYING` in the source distribution.

## Version

jq 1.4 binaries for 64-bit systems.
